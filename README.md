# Espresso_to_VHDL
Converts the Espresso output format to VHDL format. (i.e. (!b3&amp;b0) to ((NOT b3) AND b0) )

Use with:
java -jar Espresso_to_VHDL.jar
Then paste the string to convert.
The program will then output the converted string.

Adaptions and PR's are welcome. This could probably be more user friendly with a simple UI but I can't be bothered as this does the trick for me already.
